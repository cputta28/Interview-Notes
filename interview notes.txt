Java Interview Q&A :-
------------------
1) what is the piller of oops concept?
A) -> Encapslution
   ->Abstruction
   ->Inheritence
   ->Polymorphism

2) Where did you use this oops concepts in your project ?
A) >Encapslution: Entity class
   >Inheritence : Repository interface
   >Polymorphism: Service interface and Impl class
   >Abstruction : Service interface
   
   
3) Explain Exception hierarchy    ?
                     Object
					   |
					Throwable
                    _______!______
                    |			 |	
				Exception	     Error ---
				  |                       |->StackOverFlow
			|-------------|
			Checked		Unchecked

4) can we override static and private method?
A):-no we can not override static and private methods

5) what is the difference of java 7 and java 8 interface ?
A) Default and Static methods
   
6) Wthat i s final,finally,finalize?
A)  Final: keyword 
    Finally: Block
	Finalize: Object class method

﻿

7) What is equals and hashcode method and its contract?
A)
Hashcode: used to generate unique or reference number of an object 
          through which we can easily identify uniqueness of an object
Equals: used to compare object based on its content	

8)what is exception?
A) when unwantedand unexpected situation occur in program is called exception
-> to achieve graceful termination we can handle exception

9)throw and throws exception?
A) throw: it is ignore checked exceptions
   throws: create exception

10) is finally always excute?
A) yes, finally block can always excute 
	
11) how many ways we can create String objects?
A) in two ways we can create String objects
  1:- literally  - one object will  create and store in scp
            ex-> String str="Rama"; 
    
  2:- using new keyword    - two objects wil create stores 1 in heap and 1 in scp
	             ex-> String str=new String("Rama"); 
				 
12)what is scp and how it works?
A)  scp stands for String constent pool  and it will not allow duplicate objects	

13) why String is immutable?
A)  immutable means unmodifiable and unchangeble 
  -> once we assign value to the variable then we can't modify that content

 14) how to create your costom immutable class?
 A) > to make our class as final
    > to declare our instance variables as final and private
	> dont add setter methods
	> initialize all variables in constructor

15)Which one is good to store password in java String or char[] & Why
A)Here are a few reasons which make sense to believe that character array is a 
better choice for storing the password in Java than String

>Since Strings are immutable in Java if you storethe password as plain text it will be 
available in memory until the Garbage collector clears it and also String literal is stored
 String pool for reusability there is a pretty high chance that it will remain in memory for long duration.
 
>Because its difficult to destroy literal from SCP as GC unable to perform cleanup activity
 in SCP only it will destroy once jvm restarted so which may leads a high security threat.
 
> Since anyone who has access to memory dump can find the password in clear text 
and that's another reason you should always use an encrypted password than plain text	
	
	ex:-
	﻿
String strPassword-"Unknown";
char[] charPassword- new char[]('U', 'n', 'k', '', 'o', 'n');
 System.out.println("String password: + strPassword);
 System.out.println("Character password:
 
 
String password: Unknown
Character password: [C@110b053 

16) what is Marker Interface(tagging)? Can we create our own marker Interface?
A) the interface which does contain any method is called as marker Interface.
 > yes, we can create our own marker interface but it is not use because java does not know about our interface.
